This project depends on **you** to finance further development and maintenance of the project. Even small donations can go a long way. 

I offer premium support for people and companies that sponsor me through contracting or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dmonad). If you use Yjs in your company, convince your employer that you need premium support. I will be available for regular video calls, give feedback, and notify you whenever significant changes come up.
